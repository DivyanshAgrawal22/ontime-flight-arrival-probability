# ontime-flight-arrival-probability
Probability of a flight reaching a destination airport on time was obtained with a function which would take date-time, origin airport and destination airport as inputs. However, only a small number of airports were included in the project. The model was trained in Random Forest classifier and gave a probability score for a particular flight input.
