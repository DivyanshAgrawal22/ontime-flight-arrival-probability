# ontime-flight-arrival-probability
Probability of a flight reaching a destination airport on time was obtained with a function which would take date-time, origin airport and destination airport as inputs. However, only a small number of airports were included in the project. The model was trained in Random Forest classifier and gave a probability score for a particular flight input.

The flight data was collected from Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Government of the USA website. The data published here os more than enough to get started with flight delay prediction. Cleaner and seperated versions of flight data are available on my profile in Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/datasets.
